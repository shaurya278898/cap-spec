## What is CAP?

**CAP (Content / Creative AI Profile)** is a domain-specific profile within the [VAP (Verifiable AI Provenance Framework)](https://github.com/veritaschain/vap-framework), establishing cryptographically verifiable audit trails for AI workflows in content and creative industries.

CAP is **NOT** a regulation that prohibits or censors AI usage.  
CAP **IS** a framework for preserving verifiable evidence that third parties can audit when disputes arise.

> *"Leave Evidence, Not Barriers"*

## The Problem: AI's Accountability Vacuum

In December 2025, the Grok image generation incident exposed a critical gap in AI content moderation:

| What Happened | The Problem |
|---------------|-------------|
| 6,700+ harmful images generated per hour | Systems lacked provable refusal mechanisms |
| 6 regulatory jurisdictions launched investigations | No cryptographic proof of safeguard effectiveness |
| xAI claimed "we have filters" | Could not prove which requests were actually refused |

**Current AI systems can prove what they generated. They cannot prove what they refused to generate.**

This asymmetry creates:
- **Regulatory liability**: No evidence that safety measures actually worked
- **Litigation exposure**: No proof of specific refusal decisions
- **Trust deficit**: "Trust us" is no longer acceptable

---

## What CAP Provides

CAP provides **evidentiary infrastructure**, not content judgment:

| CAP Does | CAP Does NOT |
|----------|--------------|
| ✓ Record AI workflow events | ✗ Prohibit or censor AI |
| ✓ Create tamper-evident audit trails | ✗ Determine copyright infringement |
| ✓ Enable third-party verification | ✗ Evaluate content quality |
| ✓ Prove what was (and wasn't) generated | ✗ Make real-time intervention decisions |

---

## CAP Event Model

CAP defines four core events covering the AI content lifecycle:

```
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ INGEST  │───▶│  TRAIN  │───▶│   GEN   │───▶│ EXPORT  │
└─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
     │              │              │              │
     ▼              ▼              ▼              ▼
 Asset Input    Model         Generation      Output
 (Material      Training      (Create new     Delivery
  intake)                      content)
```

---

## SRP Extension: Safe Refusal Provenance

**SRP (Safe Refusal Provenance)** extends CAP to provide cryptographic proof that harmful content was **received, evaluated, and refused**.

### The Core Innovation

```
Request Received
      │
      ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  GEN_ATTEMPT    │ ← MUST be recorded for every request
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         ▼
   Risk Assessment
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
    ▼         ▼
┌───────┐ ┌─────────┐
│  GEN  │ │GEN_DENY │
│(allow)│ │(refuse) │
└───────┘ └─────────┘
```

### The Completeness Invariant

> **Every `GEN_ATTEMPT` MUST have exactly one corresponding `GEN` or `GEN_DENY` event.**

This mathematical constraint prevents:
- Hiding successful generations of harmful content
- Selectively logging only favorable outcomes
- Claiming refusals without corresponding attempts
